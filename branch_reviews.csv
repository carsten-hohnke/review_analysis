Auto accident We are in our second year with  Branch with  out any claims until now. Prior to this claim  every contact regarding any coverage change questions etc  have been exceptional profesional and very kind. This is way above average.                                        The claim was a total loss of vehicle and our claim was approved by the end of the second day and we received full payment within a few days.                                     According to acquaintances of ours this is unheard of in the insurance industry with other companies. My wife and I definitely give Branch a triple A and appreciate this company and their noticeable interest  in solving this claim.                                 We are excited to tell and have been telling our friends and acquaintances about Branch,4,"April 10, 2023"
Having an agent like James Duncan made the process simple. James was exceptionally professional and precise in every action that was required for both us and Branch. He kept us up to date every chance he got and was prompt on all responses to our questions concerns and needs. Thank you James for being there for us!,5,"March 27, 2023"

This was the easiest insurnace claim I… This was the easiest insurnace claim I have  ever dealt with from start to finish.  Filing a claim through the app was really easy and fast.  With in a day or two I got a call from the adjuster Christopher.  I explained the situation to him.  He stated to get a quote and we will go from there.  Once I produced the quote I received the funds!  Shockingly the best and easiest claim process,5,"April 24, 2023"
Jordan was so helpful and honest.  I will recommend Branch Insurance and Jordan to my family and friends.,5,"April 25, 2023"
Please do not promote Kelly From the outset I got the impression that I was talking to someone who completely knew about insurance and what I was trying to do (insure the home I am buying while keeping the insurance on the homeI will be selling).  Kelly found views of the home on various resources and could accurately build the right policy while saving me money.   She was cheerful likable and interesting and made the whole process of buying insurance a pleasant experience.,5,"April 10, 2023"
Tiffany did an outstanding job! Tiffany did an outstanding job once she got involved.  The reason why I didn’t rate it with 5 stars is because I initially submitted the claim via the app in December.  No response….so mid January I called and the person told me they didn’t have a claim.  She (customer service) told me it would be expedited.  Mid-February…still no response so I called back.  Once again….I’m told by customer service there is no record of this claim.  So that is when Tiffany stepped in and she got everything rolling quickly!  So the rating is not solely for Tiffany (if so it would have been 5 stars) - it is for the combined experience and delays.,4,"February 14, 2023"
At first I was scared because I never… At first I was scared because I never heard of Branch insurance before. But they did their job and got me enough to fix my truck and I'm thankful for that because it has a lot of sentimental value since my dad passed away.

Getting the claim assigned to adjuster Initially the online claim request was lost in the system and i was being directed to different tellers. But at the end one teller helped me to just file a new claim and within an hour an adjuster was assigned. It was really great on how the associate helped me expedite the process.,5,"March 30, 2023"
Hail claim Chris was tenacious in trying to contact me.  I am very often difficult to reach and after numerous attempts we finally spoke. I appreciated his diligence to speak in person.

My Branch experience. My experience with Branch was made great by your agent Cierra Warstler. She was kind patient knowledgeable and understanding dealing with a not so tech savvy old guy. She walk me through the products and the process more than once as I had called twice last week while trying to decide which way to go with my home and auto insurance purchase. Talking to her made me feel confident and assured that I was making the right decision moving to Branch.   Also involved in my decision was your ratings and discussions with my current agent and a friend who is a current independent agent both of whom gave you a green light. I hope to make this a lasting relationship. Again many thanks to Cierra!,5,"March 05, 2023"

"Real person review - Beware of this insurance company! Beware! Learn from my nightmare and do not be fooled by their lower prices! This is the most fraudulent insurance company in the United States. The company agenda is to look for every devious means to avoid paying claims. Their policy documents are written in coded terms and every statement is ambiguous. If you take time to compare their written policy to any other reputable company you will notice that no mention is made of what type of insurance they are selling to you and the reason for the ambiguity is so they can classify the policy as whatever category helps them avoid paying whenever you file a claim. I gave them a HO3 policy to match and they produced an ambiguous policy telling me that it matched the one I currently had but cost a little less. Unfortunately as a novice I did not notice that their policy did not specify plainly any category for the policy they gave me. When I filed a claim few months ago they told me ""Aha! Your policy is replacement value coverage not HO3"" (which is full coverage). Upon looking closely I saw that the document they gave me had NO category stated which they used as an excuse to call it whatever suited them to avoid paying out a claim!! It has been almost 3 months since I filed a claim for my roof damage and they have not only refused to pay for my roof replacement but have treated me like trash. I have been completely ignored until I had no choice but to file cases with every regulatory agency in the state of Texas and I plan to take the matter to litigation regardless of what the agency resolution is. I will be reviewing them on every platform I can think of until the entire world becomes aware of their scam. Don't be misled by fake 5-star reviews online.",1,"February 27, 2023"
Wonderful customer service My son was in an accident and the other driver was at fault. We started working with the other persons insurance but the guy changed his story and said that he wasn’t at fault. We called Casey and explained what happened. Casey began working on the claim and was on top of everything.  She was calling the other insurance company and doing everything she could for us. Since we had full coverage she went ahead and took care of the car processed the car and got us money for the car. I have all confidence that she will see this through until the whole matter is resolved. She’s easy to talk with and takes the time to explain things to us. I really appreciate all that she’s done. Casey Edwards is a true asset to your company.,5,"February 27, 2023"

Don’t get fooled by their low quotes!!! Don’t get fooled!!!! They don’t pay claims.  I also had delighted switching experience when I switched to Branch insurance. The problem starts when you actually file a claim with them. I had a small incident when my car got scratched and after several followups they still don’t respond. Basically they will do everything to decline your claim or discourage you to pursue.  I had my home and 2 cars insured with them and I feels what is a point of trusting them when they don’t wants to pay claims. Stay away and get a real insurance for your 2 biggest assets/investments of your life. Good luck.,1,"February 18, 2023"

Branch is Reliable and Trustworthy You never need your insurance company until well you need them. You might be concerned about working with a company that is relatively new and digital-first like Branch. I know I was concerned whan I made the switch. Branch is the real deal and trustworthy. I recently had a property loss related to ice storm damage to my roof and home interior and Branch was there to work me through the problem and settle the claim I unfortunately needed to make in a fair manner aligned with my policy. After the damage happened my wife and I had no idea what to do next catastrophic home damage was a new situation for us. We called Branch to file a claim and Brei our assigned agent was informative and courteous. She had us text photos of the damage and immediately kicked off the claims process. The insurance claims adjuster was out the same day assess the damage and make recommendations. He took time to assess all the damage and explained what his major concerns were. The repair work required removing a large tree branch from our roof which Branch covered immediately. Throughout the process Brei kept me up to date and explained the process. She worked with us through the claims process until we were compensated for the damages by Branch in alignment with our policy. Obviously nobody wants to have to file a claim. This situation was one that needed it and Branch was there for us to help make our home whole again.,5,"February 27, 2023"

In my experience as an owner and… In my experience as an owner and operator for a roofing company insurance companies traditionally view the insured as a number. Branch really surprised me when I got the opportunity to speak with Edna and I could hear the concern for the insured in her voice.  I’m happy to see smaller insurance companies like Branch with such a high caliber of integrity. I hope to see Branch continue to grow with their integrity in tact and give these crooked fortune 500 insurance companies a run for their money. Edna Vindiola has been one of the most knowledgeable and responsive insurance adjusters I’ve had the pleasure of working with. Thank you for helping us restore our mutual client’s home to pre-storm conditions.,5,"March 05, 2023"

Branch takes the stress out of a stressful situation I unexpectedly had a water line break in my basement while I was away for a few weeks and when I contacted Branch I was greeted warmly and explained the situation. I had never filed a claim and Melissa Yoder was great during the entire conversation and set me up with an estimator Mujaab Abdul-Xahir who contacted me and set up an appointment to inspect the damage when it was convenient for me.Mujabb arrived at the agreed upon time and was quite polite and thoroughly inspected the damage including taking several photos. I am a busy physician and Melissa was able to work around my schedule and gave great instructions on what was required to process the loss of property to ensure my claim was processed appropriately and rapidly.The use of EFT was unexpected but GREAT. I just had to fill in the form and the funds were deposited within 48 hours. All in all Melissa and Mujaab were exceptionally helpful kind and patient which made a typically stressful situation virtually stress free. I am MORE than satisfied with Branch and will continue to utilize your services for years to come. Thank You!,5,"January 16, 2023"

Updated: Not great for month-to-month payments This company is great if you pay six months at a time. They send reminders of the upcoming payment and everything. However if you switch to monthly payments they don’t send payment reminders they just cancel your policy immediately and charge you late fees. My card was stolen and I pay a lot of bills with autopay so I forgot to apply the new card to this bill. Suddenly I receive an email that my policy is canceled. So I’m back to six month payments. This company is not lower income friendly at all. UPDATE 3/16/23: Jake from Branch (not State Farm) 😃 called me and remedied the situation. There was an issue with the text updates and he made sure it works for me now. He went above and beyond and I really appreciate it!,5,"February 13, 2023"

Branch is the exemplar of insurance Branch has been the insurance provider that you can really count on to do the right thing the right way. Their slogan “Getting back to getting each other's back” is spot on. The horror stories of dealing with insurance companies & claims is something that Branch changed my prospective on. While dealing with a freeze weather catastrophe (burst pipe flood) on Christmas eve has been cruel exhausting stressful and broke our heart; working closely with our adjuster at Branch Mr. Brian Coldagelli has been a blessing. From day 1 Brian has been a true partner. He has been kind empathetic supportive and super approachable in every aspect prompt and efficient professional listened to our concerns and constructively guided us to navigate the confusing world of insurance while working through a claim. The frictionless customer focus and overall experience we have been rewarded by working with Brian and Branch has been exemplar and has made life easy helping us focus on the most pressing matter of rebuilding our home as quickly as possible. There aren’t enough words of gratitude that we can express. Grateful for all Brian and Branch have done for us in this extremely difficult time. Thank you!,5,"January 23, 2023"

"5 stars for Branch & LaToya my adjuster I am giving LaToya and branch all fives because of the exceptional wonderful and attentive care that we received from LaToya. I truly know that branch is a wonderful company because it came out in the interactions that I had with LaToya my adjuster. Although I had some hiccups on my side because the company I went through caused delays in my claim (almost 4 months to get back home). LaToya was right there doing her best to get them to move on repairing my home. Ultimately we had to go with a different company to help us to get our home repaired and LaToya was right there working with them also. Branch sent the funds I needed to get my home repaired quickly and took care of our temporary housing arrangements for nearly 4 months.I tell everyone I know ""If you need an insurance company call or go to branch.com because they stand by their word and they have the most professional kind and caring employees. And this review is a HUGE KUDOS to LaToya Massey my adjuster. Thank you LaToya for helping us get back in our home again.

Within three and a half hours the claim specialist Tiffany Corritgan contacted me discuss my claim about the damage to my roof home from experiencing hell and storm damage on January 11th 2023 a bad weather event I was not accustomed to such a quick response from a insurance company after spending almost two decades with State Farm. My claim specialist  she explained about the process what my insurance covered and wouldn't be covered and how the experience as a value customer who have all four vehicles and homeowners with branch insurance and how it should unfold seamlessly. And she would have a company contact me about coming out and assessing our damage ASAP. So I'm at that point hopefully everything continues to be a great experience with Branch insurance .👍,5,"January 25, 2023"

I recently totaled my truck. I was not at fault. The at fault drivers insurance was dragging their feet on the claim so I went thru my own insurance to get things going. Within  a few minutes of turning in the claim I received a text with a claim number and an adjusters name. I was skeptical as I had read bad reviews on claims from Branch. I called my adjuster Janes Cunningham. He got back to me right away got the rent car going and got my truck out of impound where it was sitting. I could not have been more satisfied with his overall performance as my adjuster. Always returned emails or calls and helped me achieve the best outcome available. I was really surprised after the reviews I had read. Renewed my waivering confidence in Branch.,5,"October 03, 2022"

He proved we mattered that he cared and that I made the right decision switching to Branch. He made everyrhing better. He has been professional and moved things alone expediently.

"Fantastic! What a fantastic company! I live in Oregon and came across ""Branch Insurance"" while searching for better rates. My previous company has been ""Progressive"" in raising their rates! I got an online quote for home & auto and was thrilled to find that Branch is going to save me about $700 a year! FANTASTIC! Especially at this time of year. Not only was I so happy to find such a huge saving I also got the opportunity to speak with Vanna. What a truly   great agent. Not only did she go over every detail of my policies but did so while ensuring I had great coverage all discounts possible & saving me a huge chunk of change! I felt like I was speaking with a friend. She was so pleasant congenial knowledgeable & professional! What an asset she is to your company! She never tried to sell me on anything but only provided me all options. I don't even have to call my previous company to cancel. Vanna let me know that Branch will take care of all of that! I am even getting ""Simpli safe"" security equipment free of charge for a small (no long-term contract) monthly fee which in turn also gives me another discount on my home owners insurance.In looking over my policy afterward I realized I had neglected something I wanted to include.  I then got the opportunity to speak with another great representative Amanda. Again Amanda was an absolute pleasure to speak with! I went away today feeling so grateful to have found such a wonderful company who seems to actually be concerned with providing excellent service/coverage at an extremely reasonable price!  In this day and age that is rare indeed! I will be spreading the word about "" Branch Insurance"" rates & the wonderful people who work there.Thank you!Pam",5,"November 19, 2022"

No response in almost 2 weeks since I submitted a claim no one returns your calls or seems to care Worst insurance company by far that I've ever dealt with. I submitted a claim almost 2 weeks ago said someone would respond but never did.  I called and left messages every day for a week and never heard back from anyone.  Sent me to a different voicemail every time I called but none of them responded.  Finally after I left a negative Google review someone called me the next day completely clueless about my case even though I had submitted the clam online and left detailed messages all week. No acknowledgment or apology just some rude person on the phone who seemed annoyed that I was making them work.  They told me they would tow the car from the police lot (car was stolen and recovered) That day and would get back to me. I waited two more days Nothing.  I left them another message on Monday and they responded via text that they were in the process of getting the car right at that moment (said the same thing on Saturday) and that they would call me once they were finished towing it.  That was 2 days ago and I have not heard from anyone or been able to get through to talk to anyone.  Absolutely pathetic and unprofessional.  Canceling my policy as soon as this is done.,1,"November 04, 2022"

Finally an Insurance Company who isn't difficult to work with! I am very pleased with how Branch handled my claim.  As soon as I filed a claim for paint correction on my car James Duncan contacted me immediately and provided me with the information needed in order to get my car repaired.  He was absolutely wonderful to speak with and kept up with me throughout the entire process.  I couldn't be any happier.  Unlike other insurance companies and/or adjusters that I've dealt with in the past James Duncan and Branch Insurance was such a breath of fresh air to work with. They made it super simple for me.  I'm truly grateful for them.  Highly recommend Branch Insurance for your insurance needs!,5,"November 06, 2022"

Low rates w/ bad customer service This company lured me in with low rates. Their rates were almost too good to be true and significantly less than I had been paying to my previous insurer.Unfortunately my when I actually needed to file a claim the experience went downhill fast. The agent assigned to my claim provided false information regarding my coverage and directly stated things would be fully covered (minus my deductible). After two estimates and several calls back and forth I've come to learn that the information provided by the agent was false.Everyone makes mistakes and I don't fault the agent for making a mistake. The reason for my 1 star review is based on how that mistake was handled by Branch.The agent and her supervisor acknowledged that I was given incorrect information and was told that my claim would be covered. They they also refuse to honor the verbal commitment of coverage and have been very blasé about it. There was no attempt to make this right with the customer.My claim was assigned to an agent that didn't understand the claim process or my policy/coverage. I'm still trying to reach a resolution on what should actually be paid out and will likely be stuck with a very large bill to pay out of pocket.Based on my personal and honest experience I won't recommend branch insurance to anyone. My advice would be to choose a more reputable company that's better suited to handle actual claims. You don't want to be in my shoes or getting bad information or call center hot-potato when you have an unexpected repair bill.,1,"September 25, 2022"

Claims Dept Has a Broken System They DO NOT have spanish speaking claims reps which should be a requirement in Texas. After reporting the claim the collision center finished the vehicle and had it ready for pickup but wouldn't release it due to not being paid by Branch. We reached out numerous times only to find out that the assigned claim adjuster was out of office and they had no way of getting someone else to fill in while the adjuster was out. We've tried getting in touch with a supervisor and got no response and every time you get in touch with someone on the claims line they can only submit new claims or send messages to the assigned adjuster on existing claims. They cannot review the details/get someone else to assist. This is a broken system that needs to be fixed because if your adjuster isn't working you'll be out of luck.,1,"September 26, 2022"

Overly satisfied to say the least! Not only did Erik understand my concerns he also showed compassion and empathy which I feel is a rare in this market/Industry. Throughout the entire stressful process Erik showed me a true sense of a relationship versus just another business transaction. After numerous negative experiences dealing with him was a breathe of fresh air to say the least.  Through my back and forth of trying to find my home he never once showed any frustration or impatience during the entire process. I could tell he truly cared about me finding the home that was best fit for my needs.  As anyone that’s ever endured this process it’s known that it’s stressful to say the least. Yet somehow Erik always found a way to make me smile and relax he consistently gave me words of encouragement and made sure to answer all my questions. I am blown away by the service provided by him and would recommend him one thousand times over! THANK YOU ERIK!,5,"September 10, 2022"

I am disgusted!!! This has got to be the worst insurance company I have ever dealt with in my life. The customer service is horrible the communication is horrible everything about this company and the way they handle customer's that don't have a policy with them makes me sick to my stomach!! I have been waiting for over a week now to get an update on a claim for an individual they insure. There is no urgency whatsoever due to the fact the accident was caused by their policy holder. You people should be ashamed. It literally takes a couple minutes to give someone an update and treat them with the decency they deserve!! They have not attempted to reach out to me once I have no vehicle to drive and no idea what is going on because the employees assigned to handle my claim are incompetent.,1,"September 07, 2022"

Our adjuster Mr. X who replaced Ms. Y who was replaced by Mr. Z (within 24 hours) and advised us that we can stop their service and do the work with someone of our choice. And now after 2 days I called to get the status of our claim and they told us that OUR CLAIM IS CLOSED. WTH? Every time you call them they will assign you a new adjuster who will tell you a new story. Also if you call Branch and tell them your problem the customer service representative will tell you that he/she will connect you with a supervisor and then there will be a long hold and there will be no NO SUPERVISOR.

"Branch is my new best friend! We were excited we finally found a new house to buy but the excitement was quickly squelched when I started searching for homeowners insurance.  I made dozens of calls during the last two weeks and was getting pretty down because the prices were so high... then today I googled the ""best homeowners insurance"" and an article came up with Branch Insurance being the top choice.  I called and talked to Tom Jann and he quoted me prices for home and auto that made me smile.  The quotes were 1/3 of what Geico quoted and $1000 less than my best quote from Farmers which didn't give near the coverage I'm getting from Branch.  The auto Insurance was literally $100 less a month than the same Farmers quote.  ... thank you so very much Branch Insurance for being my new best friend!!",5,"August 16, 2022"

YOU WILL REGRET IT Crap company. I have been with branch for a year now and they have done absolutely nothing for me. I was hit in a parking lot filed a claim and they sent me 200 dollars.

This morning I called branch to get a tow truck because my Lincoln got stuck in the middle of the road with a major mechanical issue I was told to call the cops and have them get a tow truck. WHAT DO I PAY YOU RIP OFF ARTIST FOR???????My days as a customer with branch are over. My days as a plaintiff now begin. If I pay for a service and you don’t supply it it is FRAUD AND THEFT. SEE YOU IN COURT. With that being said if you want a major headache this company is for you. If you want honest service and don’t want to be left in the dust by pass these people.

It could be a lot better. The conversation was with the adjustor does not has a friendly demeanor or tone. No proper followup on time. Adjustors are not available on Saturdays or weekends. Rest of the costumer care folks just read the same thing again and again in response if you cant undersstand them the first time. If your personal life sucks please dont show passive aggressiveness and micro aggression on costumers. If i am calling because i am in an accident I will not be in a mood to handle sass frustrated and condescending tone of voice,1,"July 27, 2022"

Hi there I’m done with Branch Insurance My name is Darnell Daniels can Branch please let new customers hear the recordings that I had with them. The reason for this new review is because you guys are still not being professional. I didn’t like the response from my first review. I don’t won’t to call Branch insurance when it mattered the most no one answered me but now that I’m doing these reviews now you want me to call. I have one paid month left on my policy but you guys can have that money. I’m done with y’all. And the claim officer Angela Goslik is just a grouchy person that don’t give anyone time to talk or explain yourself. I’m new to this claim stuff so I didn’t have any idea what I was saying but instead of her educating me on it she only got mad and hung the phone up on me. Which left me more confused. I wasted my time and money. Just take me out you guys files I hate I ever came to y’all.

Those folks don't respond and when they finally did sent me to yet another ""appraisal"" company they tell me the adjustor denied the claim for whatever reason and I can't reach the adjustors.

Dissatisfactory Experience One of the worst experiences I've had dealing with an insurance company. Their rates are one of the lowest in the market but that comes at a price that you pay after becoming a customer. I have been simply waiting on a refund after I sold my vehicle one month after paying my insurance for 6 months. It has now been 3 months and I am still waiting on a refund. There's no dispute accident or any grey area. I am simply having trouble getting refund on a vehicle that I no longer own but I paid them for insurance coverage. Horrible customer service and I would not recommend this company.,1,"May 10, 2022"
so far so good. easy to get a quote. easy to talk to someone on the phone. best price i could find except the auto was a little higher ($41 over y months) than my previous policy.,5,"May 09, 2022"

"I am in Texas and have been a Branch… I am in Texas and have been a Branch customer (home and auto) for about 6 months now.  They came highly recommended by my agent and their rates were better than my previous carrier.  So much so that my ""it's almost too good to be true you get what you pay for"" radar went up but I went with them based on my agent who is also a friend and a fantastic agent! I rarely write a review unless I've had a noteworthy positive experience - negativity generally isn't worth the energy - just move on if you can.  But in this case anyone considering Branch should be able to read about my experience.  Unfortunately I wrecked my 2017 Tundra on 3/21/2022.  At this point I became aware that Branch uses an outside company - Sedgwick - to handle the claim and a company called Snapsheet to provide the repair estimate.  The process has been lengthy and as I will get into below unfair.  After weeks of email and phone call follow ups I got the final verdict on my vehicle 29 days after the accident/claim was reported (4/29/2022).  They totaled out my truck - note their initial repair estimate was about half what the repair shop came up with - first red flag for their outside appraiser/estimator's credibility.  This (the truck being totaled) was a bit of a surprise to the body shop but after a month of waiting to hear back from them not entirely unexpected by me.  Their Damage Assessor (Snapsheet) was based out of Memphis TN and never saw my vehicle in person. The Snapsheet estimate they sent me (showing a Chicago IL address) valued my vehicle @ $30914.  I had done my research and found a base model truck in my area same year and body style with comparable miles was going to cost me between $33000-34000 (conservatively $2-3K more than their total loss valuation).  I reached out to my contact at Sedgwick (Christopher) and told him that the base estimate was a bit low.  Additionally their estimator had not accounted for my upgrades.  Bakflip bedcover running boards bed mat leveling kit custom Fuel wheels upgraded tires and a very nice after market sound system - all total about $4500-$5000 in adds.  All of which the salvage company would remove and sell as they parted out my vehicle.  Christopher basically responded that the appraisal from Snapsheet was final ""how do you want to proceed?"".  I told him I didn't think that was fair at all the base number was low even before considering the after market items and those items add additional value to the truck.  Anyone that shops for a vehicle (new or used) understands the price of a vehicle can vary by several thousand dollars depending on how it is configured as well as overall condition.  My truck condition wise was a 9-9.5 out of 10 but their estimator has only seen damage pictures.  At this point 4/20/2022 I reached out to my agent who contacted Branch who put my agent back in touch with Christopher at Sedgwick ugh.  She has been running the traps for two weeks now with both Branch and Sedgwick and has been unable to get this resolved.  Pretty scary as an insured (client) when your agent who apparently writes a good bit of insurance with Branch can't get you an answer and has become as frustrated with the situation as I am.  Where I sit now? It has been 45 days since my accident.  I waited a week to get my rental car (30 days of coverage) in order to give myself some cushion (so much for that plan).  As such the last week (and who knows how much longer) is coming out of my pocket.  Branch refuses to extend the rental coverage even though the delay at this point is clearly theirs.  And not that it's a huge amount of money they have yet to reimburse me for the tow which I paid for out of pocket - even though I provided them the receipt early on in this process.  As we sit I have no idea when how or IF this gets resolved.  Given my father worked in insurance (claims) his entire career I probably have a little more knowledge/experience with insurance and the claims process than the average customer.  This has to date been by far the worst experience I've ever had with an insurance company.   Insurance should be there when you need it right?  You should expect good timely customer service and a fair value for what you have insured.  Thank goodness the claim wasn't something catastrophic with my home!  If possible I will provide an update to let everyone know how this gets resolved.  I'm not sure that the issue isn't more with the outside firms Branch is using but ultimately it is the insurance company's responsibility to take care of their customer.  For now I'd say be very wary of this company.   Jeff - Allen TX",1,"May 05, 2022"

Double charged in a week I signed up for insurance with you guys to lower my bills and ease the financial burden we had been experiencing. Was very satisfied with my experience at that point. Until this morning when I got up and after only a week you charge me a second time for my premium for the first month. We got covid a few months back and the amount of bills that built up during that time has made it very hard to recover. We didn't have that money to pay you. That money was meant for other bills and you took it. I never authorized that payment and you have now put me in a bad place. I called in and they have credited me money back with the expectation of 5 to 7 days. I feel robbed here!  I was proud of my desicion to change to your company to save money only to be foolishly ashamed a mere week later.  You hurt my family regardless of you doing the credit back.  Charging someone another month premium a week after signing up with you?  I really don't know how we are going to recover from this.  I literally had to borrow money from work this week to pay our bills and had borrowed just enough to pay those bills and you took what wasn't meant to be yours. In my book that's robbery. Take it how you feel it but that's how it feels to me you robbed my family of money that wasn't meant to be yours. I would say to anyone reading this be aware that you could be charged a week after for your next month's premium because their billing cycle ends on the 18th. I don't really know how you guys can mend this relationship like I said before you credited the money back (supposedly i havent seen it yet obviously) with the expectation of 5-7 days to get that returned but that doesn't help me for the now for the others that I was supposed to pay with it. The late fees I incur for not paying those people that it was meant for. I'm sure your sleeping just fine at night and your conscience is clear messing up peoples lives with just a oh we're sorry about that the system automatically did that on its own we'll get that credited back to you it will take 5-7 days for that to appear in your account is that ok? No its not ok! Hopefully this helps someone else not have this happen to them!,1,"February 18, 2022"

Substantially better policy for 500$ less! I was paying the emu and lizard folk about 1000$ a year for homeowners and 110$ a month for two drivers and two cars. They wouldn’t cover my musical instruments and the policy was short on total coverage on my home even though I discussed it multiple times with them. I Called branch my coverage increased substantially the policy amount dropped 500$ I got home security with a discount on my policy to offset the home security and my car insurance dropped 15$ a month. I am an engineer and numbers are my game so I know everything lines up with  identical coverage for waaaaay less!! I thought switching would be a pain but it was absolutely painless! So happy I did it!,5,"February 06, 2022"

What a pain free experience! Called to see how much it would cost to get home and car insurance. It was recommended by Homepoint my mortgage company. Amber was so helpful patient and kind! I asked her to give me a call back because I didn’t have my vehicles information on hand and without fail she called me back at the set time. Then i asked her if i could give her a call back tonight or tomorrow because I wanted to clear some things up before deciding and she locked in my quote and sent me an email with the quote and her information. I called her back almost 2hrs later and she was on a call so i left a voicemail and not even 2minutes later she called me back and she helped me through the process with getting the coverages and with the stress free cancellation of the previous coverages. I’ve never had such an amazing experience like this before. My last homeowners insurance agent couldn’t even give me a call back ever even when he said he would wks went by without a call back smh. Amber went above and beyond and made me feel important!! Thank you Amber!! Thank you for being amazing!,5,"January 24, 2022"

After the call I found that they had dropped the ball twice on insuring my son.  I figured “That’s it!” And went online to an insurance broker and Branch was the first to be recommended.. The quote was a no brainer and Karly was so great to deal with.  She didn’t talk too fast and talked me through everything!  Branch has made everything so user friendly that it was the biggest blessing of the day!  Thank you so much Karly!,5,"January 17, 2022"

"Great Rates but issues with Homeowners and Mtg Company as well as confusiuon with Auto Coverage I thought I purcahsed We received an offer from our Mtg company (Homepoint) about switching to Branch.  I communicated with a Sales rep to get the identical home and auto coverage we had with our old insurance company.  The process was simple and the coverage took place in a matter of min once I agreed to the terms.  The one snag we have run into (and I do not know if this is an issue with branch or our Mtg Company) is when the new HO info was sent to Mtg Company the amount and policy number were correct but the company info said Axis not Branch.  I called and spoke with a Rep who will be attempting to correct the issue after the MLK Holiday but Axis was paid and now my escrow is all messed up.  She did say she noticed a ""known"" issue so I am not sure what that means.  Does it mean when Branch works with the Mtg Vendor they are sending the wrong underwriting company? I figured maybe Axis was used to underwrite our HO in our state but the Declaration Page shows underwritten by ""GENERAL SECURITY NATIONAL INSURANCE COMPANY"". One thing the Rep asked for was my Loan # and then she said she had it but come to find out the loan # she had on file was wrong.  Maybe that is where the hiccup took place.  Either way I also emailed Homepoint to cover all bases as well as Axis.  My biggest concern is once Branch and Homepoint get this issue resolved (which the Rep along with another Rep from Branch stated my HO policy will remain in place even-though the payment from escrow is delayed at this time) will we have two checks paid out from escrow and if so how long to get Axis to refund our escrow. In the meantime I do not want a new escrow analysis to take place while my escrow is in a negative balance due to this.  The whole reason for switching to Branch (based on Homepoint recommendations) was to not have our pmt go us as our other insurance company was raising rates again this year.  If/when this issue is resolved I am happy to change my star rating to a 4-4.5 rating.  I would still not provide a 5 star until or if we ever have a claim and see how that plays out.**Update 1.18.22**Homepoint still has the info wrong about our home policy.  Once again I have no clue if this is Branch or Hompoint but I have another email out to both on the matter.  I did also go back and review the auto coverage I purchased and I am trying to get some clarification of Comprehensive Coverage we have purchased as it relates to Auto Glass Repair as the Policy said I did not purchase Window Glass Coverage.  When I have used other insurance companies in the past if we had a windshield that needed repair or replace the Comprehensive handles that process.  Maybe Branch sells a separate add on for Window/Glass if you decide against Comprehensive. Also my policy reads no Uninsured coverage but in another section it shows we purchased.  Confusion on coverage!  I am now wondering if this was a good decision to switch.  Maybe they respond and make all this right!  If not back to our old company I guess.**update 1.18.22 @ 11:30am**I spoke with Tina at Homepoint in the Insurance Dept and she did an excellent job explaining the situation.1. It seems Homepoint has sent multiple requests to Branch to have the correct code to show Branch as the HO Insurance company. Or in our case GENERAL SECURITY NATIONAL INSURANCE COMPANY as the underwriting company Branch used for our policy2. Homepoint shows Axis as our Insurance because they do not have the appropriate code for Branch / GENERAL SECURITY NATIONAL INSURANCE COMPANY. They did verify that they mailed a physical check to PO Box 340380 #42184 Columbus Ohio 43234-0380 so Branch or  GENERAL SECURITY NATIONAL INSURANCE COMPANY should see the payment for our policy in the coming days or week. I will continue to check online to see if Branch received the check and applied it to our policy3. When they mailed the check (check # xxxxxxx) they also asked that Branch provide the Company info so they can process and show in their system properly as Branch / GENERAL SECURITY NATIONAL INSURANCE COMPANY4. They were able to also redo the escrow analysis properly so it does not appear our mtg payment is going up and escrow account balance is accurate5. The Sales Rep who sold our policy did verify Auto coverage so it seems this is corrected...Thank you Branch for clarification. **Please pass all this info to your customer support team if needed. I just want to make sure all this is corrected in a timely manner. Someone in support was supposed to be contacting Homepoint to resolve the payment confusion.**I have adjusted the star rating from 4 to 2 but I am changing back to 3 for the time being and will see how this all plays out.update 1.19.21It seems that the original HO Policy had the wrong Homepoint Loan # which has been corrected. Now they seemed to have removed my son and added a staranger to my auto policy. Support corrected but WOW THIS IS NUTS!",1,"January 17, 2022"

I'm doing 3 stars right now. I'll see how things goes. So far I am happy. Progressive the insurance deceived me. They gave me a low price and after I did driving test them my pricewent up. And that drivers test showed I was a good driver. But instead my rates kept going up so I tired of being taken. So that's why I give 3 stars for now. If your not like progressive and keep given postive experience I see 5 stars for you.,3,"January 16, 2022"

Better than I Expected I set up Kangaroo camera this morning around 3:30am and by 9am I had a call from Ashley helping me to secure my home and car. What I thought would be a typical sales call was so much more. Ashley is amazing and so knowledgeable. (Don't ask for her because I'm not sharing.

After seeing what it was  costing to replace house only a few doors down I was paying close attention to my policy no one could match what my past insurance company would give to rebuilt my home so I kept paying the higher price until I found Branch Insurance. They gave me more and at half the price after doing my research  I decided to switch so far so good it was easy to make the change and if I had questions? all I had to do was make a call. So if you want to save on your Home Insurance and get a great price  and still have what you need check out Branch Insurance.,5,"November 24, 2021"

Situation unresolved The agent who sold me my policy told me my Arlo security system would work for a discount on my homeowner insurance. Next thing you know they can’t decide if does or doesn’t. Issue still not resolved. One week later. Undecided if  I would renew with this company next year. They can’t seem to get there  act together. So far not really impressed with this company. I hope I don’t have a claim with this company the next 12 months. Especially since  they can’t make a simple decision on wether my security system qualifies or not.

I have found that insurance is a time… I have found that insurance is a time consuming process that is a minefield of rip-offs and misrepresentations. I managed to talk with a Branch rep within 3 min. Many such as Geico would have you spend 40+ min on the phone before talking to a human. The process was easy and did not require you to spend more of your free time taking pictures of the interior of your house as did Hippo who also misrepresented their binding agreement stating it was binding as of midnight the day the credit card was given but later emailed stating it was binding 48 hours after they received 'acceptable' pictures of the interior of the house. The insurance package cost I received from Branch was slightly better than other companies. They valuated the home properly which agents for Allstate were unable to do. Allstate thought a rebuild could be done for $100/square foot meaning that a client would have been screwed if their house burned down and they would have had a payout for about 50% of what the rebuild would have cost. The cost of the the Branch policy was approx 200 less than competitors for similar coverage but was also a realistically as ineffectual as competitors policies as to make it affordable I went with a 2% deductible of 10000 which effectively renders the policy only useful for complete destruction of the house as minor damage will very seldom be covered by a 1% deducible and I am sure never with a 2% deductible.  In the future when the kids move out I am likely to exit the insurance game and downsize the house and simply pass on insurance and take the risk of complete destruction of my house as the insurance rates for minor perils are far too expensive given their absurd deductibles and the risk of complete destruction of a home in most places is exceedingly low.,4,"October 26, 2021"

She appeared very knowledgeable of the product and was able to quickly walk me through the enrollment process and switchover from Allstate.   I had an overall positive experience with Allstate especially in claims handling but the dollar savings was too much to ignore.,5,"October 08, 2021"

"Sales agent extraordinaire Like most people we dreaded the ordeal of researching home and car insurance rates as we considered changing insurance companies. We were delighted with the service our sales agent provided. We had several questions via both phone and email that she was able to answer in a quick efficient manner. After receiving a revised quote we noted that every change requested/addressed was corrected accurately. The whole process was ""painless"" and she took the time to ""walk us through"" a technical issue we were having with the app that needed to be downloaded. We could hear the smile in her voice and she definitely went above and beyond her job description during our interactions with her. We are set up to change companies and look forward to doing business with Branch Insurance .",5,"September 22, 2021"

I have had to push them to do this. And it still isn't done. So I did it myself. The second had to do with photographing my inventory. I cannot find anyway to do that in the app (which is what they eventually got around to telling me I had to do) and wanted some instructions. I got one reply to my second request which did not answer my questions/concerns and then no reply to my third request. I am not a very happy customer and I just signed up.,1,"September 08, 2021"

Insurance made easy with excellent customer service! I just purchased a new insurance policy with Brand and I was extremely impressed with assistance I received from my Sales Agent Jake Sasse.  I originally signed up online for a policy but I was a little hesitant to pay for a policy online (I’m old school) therefore I called Branch just to confirm my quote. I’m glad I did because Jake not only provided me with a lower quote than I received online but I have more coverage; my monthly payments are less; and since I’m currently covered under my old insurance until the 21st of the month Jake has pushed my start date up to the same day Branch (Jake) will canceled my current policy for me.

There were complications with my insurance and I had given up on getting any help with my car financially or otherwise but Charlie the manager of the claims department personally called me & made sure my car was taken. There were loop holes and they DID NOT HAVE TO PAY. However Charlie and his team recognized my issues and made it their business to cover my accident because it was the righ thing to do. Because of their claims department I want no other car insurance. Their prices are more than reasonable as well.  I would encourage everyone to give them a try.,5,"May 21, 2021"

Great experience with the quote and setup process The quote and sign up process has been really great! Lots of flexibility in pulling together different plans for you to evaluate what works best for you and see how it affects the cost. I also really liked that they help cancel with your current insurance company by drafting a letter for you to review and sign that they send on your behalf. Setting up the account and accessing my information was super easy. Downloading of the app was also easy as well. The PC and app interfaces are really user friendly. The online chat was very responsive and helpful. The best part is definitely the price we were able to cut our premium in half! We signed up with the community program to get the additional discounts. Adding that to our devices via the app was also very simple. So far really liking our experience!,5,"April 14, 2021"

"The buying process worked for me. In March of 2017 my Homeowners Insurance cost was $658.44. The latest renewal starting in March 9 2021 they sent me was $1544.64. USAA could not give me a satisfactory explanation. So I begin to shop for new Homeowners Insurance. I must say that as I am writing this I am still worried that this could be a ""to good to be true"" scenario but i hope not. In terms of rating the process of buying the insurance. It was simply remarkable. Very easy online application the notifying of cancelling with my current provider USAA and collecting payment from my mortgage company was a great value to me. However I will be quite upset if Branch comes back with any type of extra cost not disclosed n the documents that I signed today.",5,"March 01, 2021"
Easy to Sign Up & Customize Plan This was a pleasant website to navigate through (graphics are very pretty) and very easy to adjust coverage and choose the best policy.

Makayla Kinsley your representive did a good job of reviewing all of the covered insurance items on both of the Home and Auto coverages. She was very helpful in making sure the coverage was what I needed. I'm looking forward to competitive insurance rates in the future with Branch Insurance Company. Pryor insurance companies that I have used in the past started out with fair and competitive rates only to raise the rates every year to the point the rates were much more than other insurance companies. When that happens time to change. Thanks to Branch for the good rates.,5,"February 28, 2021"

New concept with on-line Insurance Since we just signed up with your company I can't tell how you're going to respond when and if I have need to file a claim. The rep John has done a fine job of covering all my concerns. Two things could be better I would like to get a printed policy from the company making copies off the internet is kind of weird and I had to find a another company to cover my RV's that defeats the purpose of combining all my needs under one policy. John said you may do something in the future,4,"February 12, 2021"

Awesome First Impression with Branch! We are new to Branch Insurance. John K. was great to work with as we figured out the right types of insurance and coverages for us. The online experience was seamless (we didn't even need to put in our temporary credentials as the link to the online account for signature knew who we were already). The Mobile app is VERY straight forward and simple to use. If Branch Insurance is as good in their support and renewal processes (without gouging us at renewal like most other providers) we will be Branch Members for LIFE!SO FAR SO GOOD!,5,"February 06, 2021"

Disappointed When I was solicited the agent told me that she would cancel my current insurance with Geico on the same day Branch would kick in.  But this did not happen and I got billed by both insurance subsequently I went on the Geico site to access my account and found that the same coverage offered by branch was $90. cheaper and I even added roadside assistance which wasn't offered to me by the agent.

Seamless transactions with comparable coverages and at significant savings. In a market that is super competitive and in a time of great financial constraints I needed to shop for more affordable insurance for Auto and Home. Branch Ins was shared by one of the Big 5 businesses site after they could not provide a quote for me - a long time customer. Banch's website was intuitive and informative so self service was easy. Being able to customize coverage was beneficial so as to not over-insure and over-pay. I saved over $500 on Home Owners and $194 on Auto policies for comparable coverages.My previous Ins Provider threw their best pass at me after and when it was discovered that I was moving on and even so they were not able to match my Auto Coverage with Branch. As a longtime customer I was disappointed that their offers to retain me once I left was way better than the renewal quote I was sent prior.. why not take care of your dependable clients with the best deal All The Time?This is my first year with Branch and so far the initial process and switching transactions were seamless with comparable coverages and at significant savings.,5,"December 01, 2020"

I look for companies which care about people and want to make a difference Branch fit this description. Switching my insurance to Branch was quick and seamless. I got a quote online and was a bit hesitant as I wanted to confirm I would have the same level of coverage. Before I had a chance to go back in I received an email for their agent. The agent was able to customize my policy and walk through all my coverages to make sure I would have the same protection. Once I switched she helped me log into their app to see my policy documents and Branch even sent a letter to my current insurance company to tell them I had switched. I appreciated how personal the whole experience was including information how to save by referring friends and family.,5,"October 09, 2020"
Branch is great! I have had an excellent experience with Branch.  I interacted with two team members and they were both extremely helpful. I like the user experience on the app and website and I think the rewards are fun. (gift cards for people getting quotes discounts if someone vouches for me etc.),5,"October 05, 2020"
Branch Insurance has been nothing but great so far.  I am a new customer.  They made the process of switching over extremely easy.  Customer service was fantastic.  I am glad I found Branch insurance.  They are going to save me over $400/year.,5,"October 04, 2020"
